findgrep
========

This is now a wrapper to the ag program, which works much faster than the find and grep combo that it was using.

Set of utilities to recursively find and grep, mostly for developers.  Works on mac and linux.

Put the files in your path.  I find it useful to just sync to a ~/Dropbox/bin folder, then add that to the path.
